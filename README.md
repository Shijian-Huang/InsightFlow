# DeepDoc

DeepDoc is an AI-powered research workspace for reading and understanding academic papers. Upload PDFs or analyze arXiv papers, read the original PDF side by side with an evidence-grounded AI brief, and generate references, slide outlines, and optional narrated videos.

DeepDoc is organized around projects:

- A **Project** is the workspace container.
- A **Paper** is one resource inside a project.
- A single-paper analysis is simply a project with one paper.
- Multi-paper projects use the same workspace layout and add lightweight paper navigation.

## Features

- Upload one or multiple PDFs.
- Analyze arXiv papers by search or direct arXiv ID / URL.
- Use one unified workspace for single-paper and multi-paper reading.
- View AI understanding and the original PDF side by side.
- Overview, Evidence, References, and Slides tabs.
- Keep signed-in history isolated by Supabase user.
- Store signed-in source PDFs and generated artifacts in Cloudflare R2.
- Let anonymous visitors analyze papers in browser-only mode.
- Reanalyze a paper in another mode without overwriting the existing analysis.

## Stack

- FastAPI
- Static HTML/CSS/JS
- Gemini
- Supabase Auth + Postgres
- Cloudflare R2
- PyMuPDF
- Optional Piper + ffmpeg for narrated MP4 generation

## Quick Start

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv ai-service/venv
ai-service/venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create `ai-service/.env`:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
```

```bash
cd ai-service
venv/bin/python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

Open:

- App: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- API docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Health check: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

For Supabase, R2, Render, and MP4 setup, see [Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md).

## Testing

```bash
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/deepdoc-pyc ai-service/venv/bin/python -m unittest ai-service/test_projects.py
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/private/tmp/deepdoc-pyc ai-service/venv/bin/python -m py_compile ai-service/storage.py ai-service/main.py ai-service/test_projects.py
node --check ai-service/static/app.js
git diff --check
```

`ai-service/test_models.py` calls Gemini to list models and is an external API probe, not a normal local regression test.

## Runtime Data

Generated runtime files are ignored by git.

- Uploaded/source PDFs: `ai-service/uploads/`
- Local JSON analysis records: `ai-service/data/analyses/`
- Generated videos: `ai-service/data/videos/`
- Regression outputs: `ai-service/data/eval_*`
